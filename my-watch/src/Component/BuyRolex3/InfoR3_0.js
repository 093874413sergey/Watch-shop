      <Tab eventKey="Service" title="Service">
        <p> Any mechanical watch requires regular service or, as it is also called, repassage. If you are interested in watches, then you know this well, but the question is how often should the watch be serviced.

            Watch lovers are generally divided into two camps: some give their watch for maintenance every 3-5 years, blindly trusting the recommendations of manufacturers, while others only notice irregularities in the watch, for example, deterioration in the accuracy of movement or the efficiency of self-winding. But it's probably best to stick to a set of "rules" based on both approaches.
            Popular Swiss-made synthetic oils have a shelf life of 6 years. It turns out that the frequency of maintenance is reduced only to the properties of watch oil, and the mechanism itself does not play a role?

            Every watchmaker has come across a watch that has not been serviced for ten years or even several decades, but was in fair condition and worked properly. And, on the contrary, some mechanisms showed significant deterioration after 3-4 years of operation. The fact is that the design features and workmanship of the mechanism have the greatest influence on the degree of wear and the greater its power reserve, the more often the need for prevention arises.
